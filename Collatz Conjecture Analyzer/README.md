# Collatz Conjecture Analyzer

This repository provides a solution in Python to analyze sequences generated by the Collatz conjecture.

## Problem Description

The Collatz conjecture (also known as the 3n+1 problem) is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It states:

For any positive integer n:

- If n is even, divide it by 2: n → n/2
- If n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1: n → 3n + 1
- Repeat the process with the resulting number

The conjecture claims that **all sequences eventually reach 1**, regardless of the starting number. However, this has not been proven mathematically, despite being verified for numbers up to 2⁶⁸.

## How It Works

The program:

1. Generates Collatz sequences for given starting numbers
2. Tracks sequence length (number of steps to reach 1)
3. Finds the maximum value reached in each sequence
4. Analyzes patterns across multiple sequences
5. Identifies numbers with interesting properties

## Usage

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
python collatz_analyzer.py
```

The program will:

- Analyze individual interesting numbers (27, 97, 871, 6171)
- Analyze a range of numbers (1 to 100 by default)
- Display statistics about sequence lengths and maximum values
- Show patterns found in the sequences

## Example Output

```text
Collatz Sequence for n = 27
============================================================
Sequence length: 112 steps
Maximum value reached: 9232

Sequence: 27 → 82 → 41 → 124 → 62 → 31 → 94 → 47 → 142 → 71 → ...
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Mathematical Background

The Collatz conjecture was proposed by German mathematician Lothar Collatz in 1937. Despite its simple rules, the problem remains unsolved. Some interesting facts:

- The number 27 takes 112 steps to reach 1
- The highest value reached in the sequence starting from 27 is 9,232
- All numbers tested up to 2⁶⁸ eventually reach 1
- No counterexample has been found, but no proof exists either

## Interesting Numbers to Try

- **27**: Takes 112 steps, reaches 9,232
- **97**: Takes 119 steps
- **871**: Takes 179 steps
- **6171**: Takes 262 steps
