### 🗺️ Traveling Salesman Problem Solver
**The Most Famous NP-Hard Problem**

Tackle one of computer science's most celebrated challenges! Given cities and distances, find the shortest route visiting each city exactly once. This problem saves logistics companies billions annually while remaining computationally intractable for large instances.

**Five Complete Algorithms:**
1. **Brute Force**: O(n!) - Check all tours (optimal, impractical for n > 10)
2. **Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp)**: O(n²·2ⁿ) - Clever memoization (optimal for n ≤ 20)
3. **Nearest Neighbor**: O(n²) - Greedy heuristic (fast, ~75% quality)
4. **2-Opt Local Search**: O(n²) - Iterative improvement (~95% quality)
5. **Simulated Annealing**: O(n²k) - Metaheuristic (high quality, escapes local optima)

The TSP is NP-hard: for 20 cities, there are over 60 quadrillion possible tours! This implementation compares exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic approaches to show how we can still solve real-world problems efficiently.

**Applications**: UPS route optimisation, circuit board drilling, DNA sequencing, network design
